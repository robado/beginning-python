# My slow journey in learning Python

This is my repository to follow how my progress in learning Python. 

I have decided to learn some Python and tracking my progress here in Github sounded a good idea. 
After this course I'm thinking on doing a small project for example 
program that uses API.

Beginning Python
----------------
Beginning Python is a book (or a lesson on learning Python) that I bought online and though 
this would be a good start for learning Python. 
I will follow the videos and do after teacher but 
also trying to write what something does and why. 
This is mainly for me but anyone is free to look
how am I progressing.

**Publisher**: www.PacktPub.com (I think)   
**Teacher**: Willieam Fiser  
**Lessons**: Beginning Python

### Other Books of Python 
These are some lessons that I have and though on studying next!

* Deep Learning with Python by **Packt**
* Expert Python Programming by **Packt**
* Mastering Python by **Packt**
* Modern Python Cookbook by **Packt**
* Python Machine Learning by **Packt** (This is kinda maybe)
* Software Architecture with Python by **Packt** (This sounds interesting)
* Learning Robotics using Python by **Packt**

I have some more, but I have to think that will I have time or interest doing them but for now this is my small "*plan*"

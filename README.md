# My slow journey in learning Python

This is my repository to follow how my progress in learning Python. 

I have decided to learn some Python and tracking my progress here in Github sounded a good idea. 
After this course I'm thinking on doing a small project for example 
program that uses API.

Beginning Python
----------------
Beginning Python is a book (or a lesson on learning Python) that I bought online and though 
this would be a good start for learning Python. 
I will follow the videos and do after teacher but 
also trying to write what something does and why. 
This is mainly for me but anyone is free to look
how am I progressing.

#### My keynotes from this course

I think this was a pretty fun course to learn Python for very beginner. As I have coded before this so many stuff was
 pretty familiar for example **for loops** or how **if** works. But I must say from this I learned how especially 
 **Python** works and probably how to start making my own projects with this knowledge.   
   
One thing I wish that would have been shown here. It is how to install for example pipenv for every project.

Mastering Python
----------------

For the next lessons to learn Python I decided to start take this **Masterin Python** because it seems that it can 
help me to do my own projects! I scrolled fast what does it have and seem that it has a lot for helping to do 
projects. So I hope that I will learn something from this and can start doing my own projects in Python easier.

Also this lessons are *NOT* in any order, they are all independent and I will see how am I going to do them. Maybe 
will do all in ascending order but I will have to see. Because if the lessons is something what I know and is no use 
to me using time on that so i will probably skip those kinda courses!

### Other Books of Python 
These are some lessons that I have and though on studying next!

* ~~Beginning Python by **Packt**~~
* Deep Learning with Python by **Packt**
* Expert Python Programming by **Packt**
* Mastering Python by **Packt**
* Modern Python Cookbook by **Packt**
* Python Machine Learning by **Packt** (This is kinda maybe)
* Software Architecture with Python by **Packt** (This sounds interesting)
* Learning Robotics using Python by **Packt**

I have some more, but I have to think that will I have time or interest doing them but for now this is my small "*plan*"

###### There are not in any particular order. So I might do them totally randomly or in this order.
